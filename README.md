## About respository
This repository contains program to generate calibration certificate, it was created for use in my job. Program work with specific openoffice data sheet, witch was use as database and tool for create calibration certificates. Main program task is make work easier and faster, by performing repetitive activities.

## Used libraries
Program use library jOpenDocument: http://www.jopendocument.org/.

## Next versions
Next step in upgrade program is create jUnit test, abandonment openoffice data sheet and use SQL database, using Hibernate.
Another big problem is non clean code in current version (to long methods, class, bad naming).
Because update current version, require a lot of changes, data of next release is unknown. Meantime you can see my progress in repository with task from hackerranked or different project (in future).
